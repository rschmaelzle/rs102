title: 'Chapter 3: Theory Pharmacy'
description:
  "This chapter will introduce you to the most important theories that can guide your strategy. You'll learn about theories that explain health behavior change, information processing, and message effects. Just like a doctor can draw from different treatment options (e.g. pills vs. surgery), you will obtain a set of theoretically sound and thus immensely practical tools."
