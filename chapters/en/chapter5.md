### Quiz
Claim: Mass communication efforts about public health are considered as interventions by the FDA and therefore must be registered as Clinical Trials. While this creates a lot of bureaucracy, a benefit is that they are all meticulously evaluated, helping us to learn what works and what not. 
<choice>
<opt text="True.">
This statement is not correct. Pretty much everyone can run a campaign and there is no campaign registry or anything like that. In fact, most campaigns are not at all evaluated and therefore often not even the designers will learn much about their impact, let alone others.</opt>
<opt correct="true" text="False.">
You are right - this statement is not correct. Pretty much everyone can run a campaign and there is no campaign registry or anything like that. Although campaigns that are carried out by government organizations tend to be evaluated, such evaluation is costly and thus often suboptimal.</opt>

### Quiz
Keeping track of exposure is ... 
<choice>
<opt correct="true" text="absolutely essential and cannot be left out.">
Yes, exposure is the central piece in the logic - comparable to taking a pill in medicine. No pill, no cure. No exposure, no media effects.</opt>
<opt text="highly desirable, but if compromises must be made, it is better to invest more time/money on assessing outcomes.">
Since exposure is the central piece in the logic - comparable to taking a pill in medicine (No pill, no cure. No exposure, no media effects), assessing how much exposure you actually achieved is absolutely essential.</opt>

### Quiz
To increase the conclusiveness of your evaluation resutls, two key issues to think about in advance are . 
<choice>
<opt correct="true" text="i) pre-post comparison and ii) control group.">
If the situation post-campaign isn't better than pre-campaign, it cannot have helped much (unless you make the argument that without the campaign, it would have gotten even worse). A control group will help to make the case that the campaign (or exposure to communication) was causal factor that produced the improvement.</opt>
<opt text="i) that all measures be quantitative (to perform statistics and aid meta-analysis) and ii) that process data are collected (because longitudinal designs are stronger).">
Although these points are both desirable, it will help you more to show that i) the situation improved in a before-after comparison and ii) didn't improve in an control audience not exposed to the campaign/intervention.</opt>
