### Quiz
Three paths to exposure are: to buy, to beg, or to earn media coverage. 
<choice>
<opt correct="true" text="True.">
Buying time just like advertisments do is one clear path to achieve high exposure. Another route is to beg for exposure, that is to ask channels to donate time for airing messages (ion the radio, for instance, program creators are often happy to do this in order to fill slots). The third route is to draw the media's attention to the campaign and the issue more broadly. This is what PR is all about and you can find more on this under the label media advocacy
</opt>
<opt text="False.">
Buying, begging, or earning exposure are the three main choices you have and ideally you will combine them to maximize exposure while minimizing cost.</opt>

### Quiz
A ... is a connection between two nodes. 
<choice>
<opt correct="true" text="edge.">
An edge is one of the two basic units out of which graphs are constructed (the other being nodes/vertices). Edges are the links between nodes. Edges may be directed or undirected.</opt>
<opt text="weight.">
The correct answer is edge. Weight refers to the strength of an edge in a weighted network, e.g. the intensity of friendship.</opt>
<opt text="degree.">
The correct answer is edge. Degree refers to the number of edges a node has.</opt>
<opt text="path.">
The correct answer is edge. A path refers to a the route of a 'walk' from node to node via the connecting edges.</opt>
</choice>


### Code Exercise
- Execute the code: First try to fill in the gaps and run the code. The solution/hints are a last resort!
- Also, try to add a few edges and execute the code again. You can also measure other aspects of the network - check out the networkX documentation

<codeblock id="04_02_01">

You can compute various network metrics in networkX. Check out the documentation!

### Quiz
Diffusion (in communication) is  
<choice>
<opt correct="true" text="the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system.">
This is the right answer for the Diffusion of Innovations approach in communication.
</opt>
<opt text="is the net movement of anything (for example, atom, ions, molecules, people, ideas) from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. Diffusion is driven by a gradient in concentration.">
The answer refers to the concept of diffusion in chemistry, which is driven by a concentration gradient. Such a gradient might also be involved in diffusion of innovations (i.e. the idea being weakly concentrated in the beginning and then increasing), but the other answer better fits with what we mean by talking about diffusion in social systems.</opt>

### Quiz
Communication efforts within the context of public health must be exclusively funded by public sources. Private funding, or schemes that resemble those seen in political campaigns are strictly forbidden. 
<choice>
<opt text="True.">
Private money from donors, foundations, self-raised money (e.g. via crowdfunding) can be used to fund communication efforts that aim to improve public health. However, you need to consider the consequences of entering such relationships.</opt>
<opt correct="true" text="False.">
You are right, there is no prohibition of such private funding. In fact, tax-empempt regulations for non-profits etc. are intended to steer money from companies, donors etc. into directions that can be socially beneficial. However, you need to consider the consequences of entering such relationships. Obviously, it would not seem appropriate or promising to have tobacco companies gain influence over the stragey of tobacco prevention efforts. In practice, the way that lobbyism and other kinds of influence operate can be very subtle. </opt>
